<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve tried many supplements to boost my mood, focus, and workout gains. Swisschems Pregnenolone Powder stood out. After weeks of testing, I saw clear improvements in memory, stress handling, and recovery. Here’s my honest review.</p>

<h2>What Is Pregnenolone Powder?</h2>
<p>Pregnenolone is a natural <strong>neurosteroid</strong> and <strong>hormone precursor</strong> made in the brain and adrenal glands. It supports <em>cognitive function</em>, <em>mood balance</em>, and <em>adrenal health</em>. Swisschems offers a pure 5‑gram powder, ideal for mixing into shakes or water.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>I tested Swisschems Pregnenolone over 6 weeks. Each morning, I took 10 mg mixed in my protein shake. I noted:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Energy levels</strong> on low-stress days</li>
  <li><strong>Workout recovery</strong> after leg and chest sessions</li>
  <li><strong>Focus and memory</strong> during work and study</li>
  <li><strong>Mood stability</strong> under deadlines</li>
</ul>
<p>I compared these results to a baseline week without any hormone precursors.</p>

<h2>My Results</h2>
<p>By week 2, I felt less foggy in the afternoon. By week 4, muscle soreness dropped by about 30% after hard lifts. My strength kept rising: a new personal record on deadlift (+10 kg) in week 5. Stress felt lower during busy days, thanks to improved <strong>cortisol regulation</strong>. Overall, I ranked this product high for clear benefits in both mind and body.</p>
